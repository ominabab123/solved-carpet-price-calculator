The Westfield Carpet Company has asked you to write an application that calculates the price of carpeting. To calculate the price of carpeting, you multiply the area of the floor(width X length) by the price per square foot of carpet. For example, the area of a floor that is 12 feet long and 10 feet wide is 120 feet. To cover that floor with carpet that costs $8 per square foot would cost $960



You should create a class named Rectangle with the following properties Width Length Area: A single A single A single

The Area property should be read-only. Provide a method named CalcArea that calculates width X length and stores the result in the Area property

Next, create a class named Carpet with the following properties Color Style: Price A string A string A decimal

The application should have a form similar to the following. (The carpet price is the price per square foot.) When the Calculate button is clicked, the application should copy the data in the text boxes into the appropriate object properties, and then display the area and price
